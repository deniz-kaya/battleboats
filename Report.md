- # Introduction
	- ## Scenario:
	- Creating a digital version of the board game battleboats (NOT ships) using a C# console app, where the player plays against a computer.
	- ## Project requirements:
		- **A user-friendly menu of options to navigate through the program.**
			- Clear language
			- Instructions
			- Ability to quit the program
		- **A fully functioning battle boats game, which consists of:**
			- Ability to attack
			- Preventing players from attacking cells that have already been attacked
			- Ability to display the tracker board and own board for the players
			- Showing players the attacks of the opponent and their attacks and their result.
			- Ability to place ships
			- Preventing users from placing down ships where a ship already exists
			- Preventing users from placing ships outside the bounds of the board
			- Ability to detect winners
			- Detecting how many cells have been hit
			- Statistics and trackers
			- Variables such as the turn number, how many times they have been hit, missed etc.
		- **Ability of user interaction**
			- Input validation e.g. inputting coordinates
		- **Saving and reloading of the game**
			- Saving per turn so that progress can be continued if the user decides to stop playing mid-game
			- Seamless loading of the game with just the filepath of a save file.

- # Technical Solution
	- Please see files attached with this document, or check the github: https://github.com/deniz-kaya/battleboats
- # Testing
	- Please see the attached video.
- # Evaluation
	- Overall, I think that the project has been successful. It achieves all of the project requirements as it has a user friendly menu of options to navigate the program, a fully functional battle boats game with all core features, user interactions with input validation and successful saving and loading. The technical solution is well-documented and human-legible (this means no voodoo one liners and incomprehensible code). However, I believe that the project has had a few shortcomings, as listed below.
	- If I were to do the project again, I would primarily take to mind the processing time that saving the game takes. This task could be done asynchronously to provide a more seamless experience for the user. Similarly, clearing and re-printing the boards causes a noticeable delay, a system could be set in place where only the values that have been changed are printed at their respective positions on the console window, and therefore the experience is more seamless.
	- At the end of the day, this project has improved my skills within object oriented programming as I had to research certain aspects of C# data types, prominently classes. Although there were points at which my code could be improved for a better user interface, what I was able to produce is still very workable and functional, so I would consider it a success.
	- Shortcomings:
		- Noticeable delay between certain parts of the program e.g. when rendering the updated boards, when saving the game.
		- Very basic features e.g. doesn't show when a ship is sunk.
	- Potential improvements:
		- Customisable fleet.
		- Visual personalisation, e.g. change colours of sunken ships, default text colour etc.
		- Human vs Human game mode instead of just Human vs Computer.
		- Game saves menu where user can easily create and load saves (save slots).
		- Arrow-key user interactions instead of coordinate and number etc.
		- Asynchronous game saves.
		- Showing when a ship is sunk.
		- Updating changes on boards individually instead of clearing and printing the whole thing again.
